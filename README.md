# CS 4485 – Automated Disaster Damage Assessment

This project explores automated damage assessment from pre- and post-disaster aerial imagery using Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

## Objectives
- Analyze pre- and post-disaster imagery using a VLM pipeline
- Visualize damage assessments in a geospatial dashboard
- Provide a chatbot interface for querying disaster impacts
- Evaluate predictions against FEMA ground-truth labels

## Dataset
We use the xView2 Challenge dataset for building damage assessment.

> Note: Due to size constraints, datasets are not stored in this repository.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python (backend, data handling)
- Vision-Language Models (API-based)
- Leaflet / Mapbox (geospatial visualization)
- React (frontend dashboard)

## How to Run
